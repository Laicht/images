  "description": "Minho, a man in his early 30s stuck in the endless loop of corporate life, was growing tired of his monotonous routine. One day, on his way home from work, he found Yunseul, an unstable girl, tied up and abandoned at a junkyard. Unable to leave her alone, he brings her home. Can these two wounded souls, each scarred in their own ways, find healing in each other and become happy?",
