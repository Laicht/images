  "description": "\"Viva Bathhouse\" is a natural hot spring in a peaceful rural village that has been passed down through generations. Jinho, who got the bathhouse from his grandfather, finds himself responsible for running it with the help of Sejeong, his neighbour, and only employee. As they clean the bathhouse together, they accidentally come across a bundle of mysterious herbs and a herbal medicine guidebook. The intoxicating scent and the green herb bath stir up the atmosphere between the two.",
